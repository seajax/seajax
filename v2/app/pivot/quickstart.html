<h1>Developer's guide to using the Ajax version of PivotViewer</h1>
<p>Last updated 4/23/2012</p>


<h2>About this document</h2>

<p>This should be enough to get started using the HTML PivotViewer control. It is not intended as a complete API reference.</p>


<h2>Stuff you need on your page</h2>

<p>The built version of the PivotViewer Javascript file is <code>seadragon-pivot-standalone-min.js</code>, or
you can use the development version <code>seadragon-pivot-standalone-raw.js</code>. You will also need to
include the <code>PivotView.css</code> stylesheet, which sets up styles for the elements within the
viewer. Feel free to edit the styles to fit your preference (be careful with the positioning styles though, as they may have
interesting side effects). In the same directory as the stylesheet, you'll need the <code>search.gif</code> icon file too.</p>


<h2>Creating the Viewer</h2>

<p>Option 1: Put it in your markup. This is the easiest option if you have already created a CXML file and want to display
the same content to every visitor on the page. It will look something like this:</p>

<code>&lt;div class="pivot_ajax_viewer"
     data-collection="http://contoso.com/widgets.cxml"
     data-use-history="true"
     style="width:1000px;height:600px;border:2px solid gray"&gt;
    Oops, something went wrong! Make sure Javascript is enabled.
&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<p>If Javascript is disabled, the browser will display the fallback content. In order to use this method, the Pivot Ajax
script must be included in your page markup (either in the head or body), and not delay loaded because it uses the
window's load event. The <code>data-collection</code> attribute can be either a relative or absolute URL, just be sure that your
server is returning an appropriate <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header if you're using a collection hosted on another
domain. Feel free to style the div however you like, of course. If you resize it, the viewer should adjust itself
automatically. The <code>data-use-history</code> attribute specifies that the viewer should change the URL to match its
current state, and should try to read the state from the URL when the page is loaded. If you only have one PivotViewer on the page and it
won't conflict with any other page functionality, it probably makes sense to turn this feature on.</p>

<p>If you use this method, you can skip the rest of this document because you already have a fully working viewer.</p>

<p>Option 2: Call a function.</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<code>var viewer = Pivot.init(document.getElementById("viewerDiv"));</code>

<p>The init function is the only way to construct a Viewer object, to which you can then add content. You can make multiple
Viewers on the page if you like.</p>


<h2>Adding content to your Viewer</h2>

<p>Option 1: If your content is represented by CXML, use the <code>CxmlLoader</code>. Here's an example:</p>

<code>Pivot.CxmlLoader.load(viewer, "http://contoso.com/widgets.cxml");</code>

<p>Option 2: For any other data source, you'll need to call several Viewer methods.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to set a title for your collection. You can do this at any time.</p>

<code>viewer.setTitle("Widget catalog");</code>

<p>Next, you'll need to set up the "facet categories" or "pivot properties" for your collection. You can do this by a call
to the Viewer's <code>setFacets</code> method. Let's set up our widget catalog with some basic facets:</p>

<code>viewer.setFacets({
    "Price (USD)": {
        type: "Number",
        isFilterVisible: true,
        isWordWheelVisible: true,
        isMetaDataVisible: true
    },
    Features: {
        type: "String",
        isFilterVisible: true,
        isWordWheelVisible: true,
        isMetaDataVisible: true
    },
    "Release Date": {
        type: "DateTime",
        isFilterVisible: true,
        isWordWheelVisible: true,
        isMetaDataVisible: true
    },
    "See also": {
        type: "Link",
        isFilterVisible: false,
        isWordWheelVisible: false,
        isMetaDataVisible: true
    },
    Availability: {
        type: "String",
        isFilterVisible: true,
        isWordWheelVisible: true,
        isMetaDataVisible: true,
        orders: [{
            name: "Most available",
            order: [
                "In stock",
                "Short supply",
                "Back ordered",
                "Discontinued"
            ]
        }]
    },
    "Image URL": {
        type: "String",
        isFilterVisible: false,
        isWordWheelVisible: false,
        isMetaDataVisible: false
    }
});</code>

<p>A few notes about the <code>setFacets</code> method:</p>

<p>You may only call <code>setFacets</code> when there are no items in the collection. Valid types are <code>"String"</code>, <code>"LongString"</code> (which
gets treated like String), <code>"Number"</code>, <code>"DateTime"</code>, and <code>"Link"</code>. <code>isFilterVisible</code> corresponds to whether the facet shows up
in the filter selection pane and the sort order drop-down. <code>isWordWheelVisible</code> corresponds to whether the facet category
will be accessible via the search box. <code>isMetaDataVisible</code> corresponds to whether the facet shows up in the details pane
(on the right side of the viewer). Any facet is expected to support multiple values (in this example, note that "Features" is defined
just like the other facets, despite the fact that one widget may have many features). Custom sort orders, as shown in
"Availability", let you choose orders other than the default A-Z and quantity orders in the filter pane. Furthermore,
the first custom order defined will be used for graph view on that facet category.</p>

<p>Next, you may wish to set legal info for your collection. This step is completely optional; if you do it, the details
pane will have a link at the bottom to the page you specify.</p>

<code>viewer.setCopyright({
    name: "Notices and Copyright Information",
    href: "http://www.contoso.com/widgets/legal.html"
});</code>

<p>You'll also need to set up some templates that specify how to draw individual items onscreen, by calling the Viewer's
<code>setTemplates</code> method. Like <code>setFacets</code>, this method may only be called while the collection is empty (either before you add
any items, or after they have finished clearing).</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "color",
        width: 80,
        height: 60,
        template:
            '&lt;?\
                var map = {\
                    "In stock": "#eee",\
                    "Short supply": "gold",\
                    "Back ordered": "orange",\
                    Discontinued: "orangered"\
                };\
                map[facets.Availability[0]]\
            ?&gt;'
    },
    {
        type: "html",
        width: 1000,
        height: 750,
        template:
            '&lt;div style="position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;\
                         right:0;border:10px solid black;font-size:5em"&gt;\
                &lt;div style="position:absolute;width:700px;height:730px;right:0"&gt;\
                    &lt;?name?&gt;\
                    &lt;br/&gt;\
                    &lt;a href="&lt;?href?&gt;"&gt;\
                        &lt;img src="&lt;?facets["Image URL"][0]?&gt;"/&gt;\
                    &lt;/a&gt;\
                &lt;/div&gt;\
                &lt;div style="width:260px;height:430px;font-size:.5em;\
                            padding:300px 0 0 10px;background:&lt;?\
                    var map = {\
                        "In stock": "#eee",\
                        "Short supply": "gold",\
                        "Back ordered": "orange",\
                        Discontinued: "orangered"\
                    };\
                    map[facets.Availability[0]]\
                ?&gt;"&gt;\
                    &lt;?facets.Availability[0]?&gt;\
                &lt;/div&gt;\
            &lt;/div&gt;'
    }
]);</code>

<p>The template system is confusing enough to deserve its own article, but we'll come back to it later. Suffice to say for
now that anything inside <code>&lt;? ?&gt;</code> delimiters in the template gets evaluated in-place in the scope of the current item. You
can have as many template levels as you like, but each one should have approximately the same aspect ratio. The width
and height of each level specify the highest resolution at which it will be drawn, unless it's the biggest level.</p>

<p>Once you have templates and facet categories set up, you can add the items to your collection. Each item should have a
name, description, and URL as well as its facets. Each item must also have a unique ID string, which you may provide. If
you don't provide an ID, one will be generated automatically. It's best to provide IDs for either all of your items or
none of them, to avoid possible conflicts between your IDs and the auto-generated ones.</p>

<code>viewer.addItems([
    {
        id: "789a",
        name: "Widget type A",
        description: "Our best selling widget yet!",
        href: "http://store.contoso.com/789a",
        facets: {
            "Price (USD)": [7.99],
            Features: ["Lifetime warranty", "Backward compatibility"],
            "See also": [{
                content: "Widget exchange",
                href: "http://forums.contoso.com/widgetexchange"
            }],
            "Image URL": ["http://img.contoso.com/789a"],
            Availability: ["In stock"],
            "Release Date": [new Date("Sat, 01 Aug 2009 21:13:25 GMT")]
        }
    },
    {
        id: "789b",
        name: "Widget type B",
        description: "An alternative to the popular Type A",
        href: "http://store.contoso.com/789b",
        facets: {
            "Price (USD)": [17.99],
            "Image URL": ["http://img.contoso.com/789b"],
            Availability: ["Short supply"],
            "Release Date": [new Date("Sun, 01 Aug 2010 21:13:25 GMT")]
        }
    }
]);</code>

<p>A few notes about the <code>addItems</code> method:</p>

<p>All item properties are optional. Each facet value, if provided, must be in an array even if there is only one value. If
there are no values for a facet category, just leave that category out of the facets object. The facet category names
are case sensitive.</p>


<h2>What if your content changes?</h2>

<p>In order to change data on an existing item, you should get a reference to the item, change something, and then call
addItems with that item to make sure the viewer updates its data bindings.</p>

<code>var widgetB = viewer.getItemById("789b");
widgetB.facets.Availability[0] = "Back ordered";
viewer.addItems([widgetB]);</code>

<p>It is best to use this infrequently, and if you do, update as many items at once as you can. Each time you call <code>addItems</code>
forces a sort-and-filter operation, which could be jarring from a user perspective.</p>

<p>If you need to swap out the entire collection for something new, call the <code>clearItems</code> method. That will start animating
the items offscreen, but you should wait for the <code>"itemsCleared"</code> custom event before trying to do anything else to the
Viewer.</p>

<code>viewer.clearItems();
function addNewStuff() {
    viewer.removeListener("itemsCleared", addNewStuff);
    // now we can safely call setTemplates, setFacets, and addItems.
    // .......
}
viewer.addListener("itemsCleared", addNewStuff);</code>


<h2>Templates, revisited</h2>

<p>Let's look in detail at a template example from earlier:</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "html",
        width: 1000,
        height: 750,
        template:
            '&lt;div style="position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;\
                         right:0;border:10px solid black;font-size:5em"&gt;\
                &lt;div style="position:absolute;width:700px;height:730px;right:0"&gt;\
                    &lt;?name?&gt;\
                    &lt;br/&gt;\
                    &lt;a href="&lt;?href?&gt;"&gt;\
                        &lt;img src="&lt;?facets["Image URL"][0]?&gt;"/&gt;\
                    &lt;/a&gt;\
                &lt;/div&gt;\
                &lt;div style="width:260px;height:430px;font-size:.5em;\
                            padding:300px 0 0 10px;background:&lt;?\
                    var map = {\
                        "In stock": "#eee",\
                        "Short supply": "gold",\
                        "Back ordered": "orange",\
                        Discontinued: "orangered"\
                    };\
                    map[facets.Availability[0]]\
                ?&gt;"&gt;\
                    &lt;?facets.Availability[0]?&gt;\
                &lt;/div&gt;\
            &lt;/div&gt;'
    }
]);</code>

<p>This is mostly a bunch of HTML, which will be rendered inside a container element that has absolute position and the
width and height we requested (1000 x 750, in this case). Data binding to the item's properties is done by simple string
replacement: anything inside <code>&lt;? ?&gt;</code> delimiters is evaluated within the scope of the item. This means you can access all
of the same properties that you set in the <code>addItems</code> method call above. Of course, this also means that both the source of your
content and the source of your templates must be fully trusted because an XSS attack against this system would be trivial. As you can see
in this example, binding can be done within attributes or as separate nodes. Also, you're free to define new variables within the template;
just make sure to use the <code>var</code> keyword so you don't pollute the global namespace. Just like any other HTML, you may define styles
either in the page's stylesheets or inline.</p>

<p>The reduce method on Array objects comes in handy for listing multiple values of a facet, as in this simple template
which creates a list of all Features facets in an item:</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "html",
        width: 500,
        height: 375,
        template:
            '&lt;ul&gt;\
                &lt;?\
                    facets.Features.reduce(function (previous, current) {\
                        return previous + "&lt;li&gt;" + current + "&lt;/li&gt;";\
                    }, "");\
                ?&gt;\
            &lt;/ul&gt;'
    }
]);</code>

<p>Generally speaking, HTML templates look and feel great for the higher resolution levels but perform terribly for the
lower levels where hundreds or thousands of items can be onscreen. What other options are there to keep performance up?</p>

<p>The first option is a <code>"canvas"</code> type template, which uses canvas primitives instead of HTML. It might look something like
this:</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "canvas",
        width: 100,
        height: 75,
        template: function (ctx, x, y, w, h, item) {
            var map = {
                "In stock": "#eee",
                "Short supply": "gold",
                "Back ordered": "orange",
                Discontinued: "orangered"
            };
            ctx.strokeStyle = "black";
            ctx.lineWidth = w / 100;
            ctx.strokeRect(x + w / 200, y + w / 200, .99 * w, h - .01 * w);
            ctx.fillStyle = map[item.facets.Availability[0]];
            ctx.fillRect(x + w / 100, y + w / 100, .26 * w, .73 * w);
        }
    }
]);</code>

<p>The template is provided as a function. <code>ctx</code> is a canvas 2d context on which you can draw; <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the coordinates of
the top left corner of the item's rectangle; <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> are the width and height of the rectangle you should be drawing in,
and <code>item</code> is the current item object.</p>

<p>Since we want to be able to load templates from JSON, you can also specify the same canvas method as a string:</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "canvas",
        width: 100,
        height: 75,
        template:
            'var map = {\
                "In stock": "#eee",\
                "Short supply": "gold",\
                "Back ordered": "orange",\
                Discontinued: "orangered"\
            };\
            ctx.strokeStyle = "black";\
            ctx.lineWidth = w / 100;\
            ctx.strokeRect(x + w / 200, y + w / 200, .99 * w, h - .01 * w);\
            ctx.fillStyle = map[item.facets.Availability[0]];\
            ctx.fillRect(x + w / 100, y + w / 100, .26 * w, .73 * w);'
    }
]);</code>

<p>The <code>"img"</code> and <code>"color"</code> template types are just shorthand for canvas operations that draw only an image or only a colored
rectangle. They use the same string-replacement binding mechanism as the HTML templates, but should evaluate to an image
URL or a CSS color, respectively.</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "color",
        width: 20,
        height: 15,
        template: "rgb(80,100,200)"
    },
    {
        type: "color",
        width: 40,
        height: 30,
        template:
            '&lt;?\
                var map = {\
                    "In stock": "#eee",\
                    "Short supply": "gold",\
                    "Back ordered": "orange",\
                    Discontinued: "orangered"\
                };\
                map[facets.Availability[0]]\
            ?&gt;'
    },
    {
        type: "img",
        width: 160,
        height: 120,
        template: '&lt;?facets["Image URL"][0]?&gt;'
    }
]);</code>


<h2>What about using DZI/DZC images in dynamic collections?</h2>

<p>That is possible. Just set the <code>img</code> property of each item when you add them to the collection, and ignore templates
entirely. The <code>img</code> property should point to a DZI file, or a DZC with a fragment identifying which image in the DZC to
render.</p>

<code>viewer.addItems([
    {
        id: "cat",
        img: "http://contoso.com/endangeredspecies.dzc#11",
        name: "African Golden Cat",
        facets: {
            /* it would probably have some facets too */
        }
    }
]);</code>

<p>If you want to use the deep zoom image at some resolutions and replace it with templated content at other resolutions,
that is also possible. Just use a template type of <code>"sdimg"</code> and give it a maximum width and height at which to render.</p>

<code>viewer.setTemplates([
    {
        type: "sdimg"
        width: 500,
        height: 375

<h2>Can I customize the details pane?</h2>

<p>No, but you may create your own. There are custom events that would allow you to show or hide your own content if you
like: <code>"showDetails"</code> and <code>"hideDetails"</code>. The Viewer object inherits from
<code>Seadragon2.EventManager</code>, so you can use its methods to listen for updates.</p>

<code>viewer.addListener("showDetails", function (item) {
    // do something awesome with that item here
    alert(item.name);
});
viewer.addListener("hideDetails", function () {
    // stop doing something awesome
});</code>

<p>If you really want to build your own details pane, it is possible, just rather a lot of work. You should set up the
event handlers and such after you create your viewer but before you add any content:</p>

<code>// first, disable the default details pane
viewer.clearListeners("showDetails");
viewer.clearListeners("hideDetails");

// next, set up event handlers to open and close details pane
viewer.addListener("showDetails", function (item) {
    // add details pane to page
});
viewer.addListener("hideDetails", function () {
    // remove details pane
});</code>

<p>In the details pane you build, you may provide left, right, and collapse buttons if you like. Their handlers should call
the following functions (this is the same as what the default details pane does):</p>

<code>leftButton.onclick = function () { viewer.moveLeft(); };
rightButton.onclick = function () { viewer.moveRight(); };
collapseButton.onclick = function () { viewer.collapseDetails(); };</code>

<p>Calling <code>viewer.collapseDetails()</code> will raise a <code>"hideDetails"</code> event, which you should respond to normally.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can override the behavior of the viewer's <code>"showInfoButton"</code> and <code>"hideInfoButton"</code> custom events if you want
to modify the collapsed state of the details pane.</p>
